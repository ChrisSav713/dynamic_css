Building a Responsive Grid-View

Lets start building a responsive grid-view.

First ensure that all HTML elements have the box-sizing property set to border-box. This makes sure that the padding and border are included in the total width and height of the elements.

Add the following code in your CSS:

- {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  }

Read more about the box-sizing property in our CSS Box Sizing chapter.
